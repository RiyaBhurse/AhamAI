🏗️ Workflow 1: Voice-to-Tasks Pipeline
🎯 Purpose: Convert voice recordings into structured tasks


Flow Diagram:
Webhook → Set Email → HTTP Request (HF) → HTTP Request (Groq) → Merge → Code (Parse) → Google Sheets

Step-by-Step Process:
1. Webhook Trigger
What: Receives audio file + user email from Streamlit
Input:
audio (binary WAV file)
user_email (form data)
URL: https://riyabhurse99.app.n8n.cloud/webhook-test/26cd6f01-275d-421a-a248-5078087cb6b2
2. Set Email Node (Edit Fields)
What: Preserves user email throughout the workflow
Configuration:
Mode: Manual Mapping 
Field: user_email 
Value: {{ $json.body?.user_email || $json.user_email || 'not_provided' }}
Include Other Input Fields: ✅ ON
3. HTTP Request - Hugging Face
What: Transcribes audio to text using Whisper AI
Configuration:
URL: https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/openai/whisper-large-v3
Method: POST
Headers: Authorization: Bearer YOUR_HF_TOKEN
Body Content Type: n8n Binary File
Input Binary Field: audio
4. HTTP Request - Groq
What: Extracts tasks from transcription using LLaMA AI
Configuration:
URL: https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions
Method: POST
Headers: Authorization: Bearer YOUR_GROQ_TOKEN
Body: JSON with optimized prompts
{
  "model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are an expert task extraction AI. Extract ONLY actionable items from speech. Look for phrases like 'I need to', 'Remember to', 'Don't forget'..."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Extract tasks from: {{ $json.text }}\n\nReturn format: [{\"task_description\":\"action\",\"time_date\":\"YYYY-MM-DD\",\"priority\":\"High/Medium/Low\"}]"
    }
  ]
}


5. Merge Node
What: Combines Groq AI response with user email
Configuration:
Mode: Combine
Combine By: Position
Output: Both Inputs Merged Together
6. Code Node (Parse Tasks)
What: Parses AI response and formats for Google Sheets
Key Functions:
JSON parsing with error handling
Task quality validation
Email linking
Timestamp generation
// Extract and validate JSON from AI response
const rawContent = $json.choices?.[0]?.message?.content || '';
const userEmail = $json.user_email || 'not_provided';

// Parse tasks and filter quality
let tasks = JSON.parse(extractJsonArray(rawContent));
tasks = tasks.filter(task => 
  task.task_description && 
  task.task_description.length > 5 &&
  !task.task_description.toLowerCase().includes('no tasks')
);

// Format for Google Sheets
return tasks.map(t => ({
  json: {
    task_description: t.task_description,
    time_date: t.time_date || 'Not specified',
    priority: t.priority || 'Medium',
    created_date: new Date().toISOString(),
    status: 'New',
    user_email: userEmail
  }
}));

7. Google Sheets Node
What: Saves tasks to database
Configuration:
Operation: Append Row
Spreadsheet: Your Google Sheets ID\
Columns: task_description, time_date, priority, created_date, status, user_email


📧 Workflow 2: Daily Reminder System
